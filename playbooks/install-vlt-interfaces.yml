  # We need to adapt the MTU of the probing servers because else it breaks the BMP collection.
  # The reason is that the Route Monitoring BMP packets can fill up the entire MTU,
  # except the IXP servers use Wireguard with a MTU of 1420 (to account for the Wireguard overhead). So the packets are dropped,
  # and we don't received the ICMPv6 Packet Too Big notification because the IXP servers uses their non routable IPv6 address from the IX lan.
